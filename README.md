# What is this

You can consider it as a third-party reference for **Flutter**. I'm trying to record all the stuff I have learned about Flutter, hoping this will help everyone.

# How does it proceed

I am going to make it my own learning experience. That is, I'm not intended to introduce Flutter in a normal way that you prefers. **This will not suit every one**.

# About this repo

Since I'm not an excellent programmer, there will inevitably be a lot of errors in this document. If you just discover it, and if you are willing to, please make a pull request or just an issue, we can discuss and revise this together.
